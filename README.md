# OneSignal + Vue 3

This example project demonstrates how to integrate the [OneSignal Vue 3 plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onesignal/onesignal-vue3) into your Vue.js app. You can use this project as a boilerplate or a reference for your project.

## Running this sample

This project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created. If you don't have one made already, you'll need to [create one](https://app.onesignal.com/apps/new) before starting (follow our [Web Push Quickstart](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-quickstart#step-1-choose-integration) for guidance on a configuring OneSignal for a web).

1. Make a copy of `.env.example`, name it `.env.local`, then set `VUE_APP_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` to your OneSignal app ID
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install packages
3. Set `VUE_APP_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` in `env.local`
4. Start the app, `yarn serve` or `npm run serve`

Note that you will need to have a OneSignal app created before this example will work. Check the [Web Push Quickstart](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-quickstart#step-1-choose-integration) for guidance on a OneSignal app.
